## :bulb: Overview
The main goal of this project is to build a data engineering pipeline to regularly transform a messy database into a clean source of truth for an analytics team.
## :scroll: Scenario
A mock database of long-term canceled subscribers for Cademycode ( A Educational Company) Will be used. This database is regularly updated from multiple sources and needs to be cleaned and transformed into usable shapes with as little human intervention as possible.
## :bar_chart: Data
The Dataset used will be based on a frictional education company called Cademycode.
